<title>Space &mdash; The Moon Rover</title>
<para><indexterm><primary>moon rover</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>space</primary>
</indexterm>The moon rover is a relatively new entry in the transportation
realm. Since journeys to the historic Apollo 11 site have become popular,
there is considerably more interest in the moon rover as a means of transport.
Although some have questioned leaving tire tracks near mankind's first footsteps
on the Moon, the newest moon rover models do not disturb the area. </para>
<graphic fileref="moonrove.tif" scale="250"/>
<para>Moon rovers deliver more than just a celestial travelogue. Interactive
space exploration is also available. Using robotic sensors to explore the
Moon, visitors to Mission Control modules enjoy the latest in virtual reality
rides. Visitors ride on a slow-motion virtual roller-coaster ride over lunar
hills and craters - seeing, feeling and hearing everything the sensors encounter. </para>
<para>Currently, Moon Rover America&reg; is negotiating with several established
theme parks for US theme park rights. The company is also meeting with media
firms who want to beam video from the rover's moving eye to a mass audience
via the Internet.</para>
<important><title>Important Note!</title>
<para>Riding in a moon rover can be dangerous to small children and those
with heart conditions. Consult your physician before undertaking any moon
rover excursion.</para>

<primary>Satellite</primary></indexterm>As more and more corporations take
advantage of the satellite revolution, video conferencing is becoming increasingly
popular. It provides a cost-effective alternative to travel time and cost.
By broadcasting meetings to worldwide offices each month, companies save considerable
time and money by using this method of communication.</para>
<para>What is a satellite? It is a man-made object launched into orbit to
relay voice, data and video signals as part of a telecommunications network.
Signals are transmitted to the satellite from earth station antennas, amplified
and reflected back to earth for reception by other earth station antennas.
Satellites are capable of linking two or more points on earth together with
other multiple points on earth. These satellites are located in a geosynchronous
orbit approximately 22,300 miles in space over the equator.</para>
